LIBRARIES INVOLVED:

CAER:

CAER (Computer Vision in Python) is an open-source Python library designed to simplify computer vision tasks. It provides a high-level interface for common computer vision operations, making it easier for developers to work with images and videos. 

Canaro:

Canaro is a module within CAER that focuses specifically on feature extraction from images. It provides functions for extracting features using popular techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). These features can then be used for tasks such as object detection, recognition, or classification.
